# DS Florecilla

Welcome to the **Florecilla Design System** repository.

## Overview
This repository serves as the single source of truth for the Florecilla Design System. It contains the master Figma file and the exported design tokens.

## Contents

### 🎨 Design Source
- **File**: `DS-Florecilla.fig`
- **Description**: The master Figma file containing all components, styles, and layouts for the design system.

### 🪙 Design Tokens
- **File**: `tokens.json`
- **Description**: JSON export of the design tokens (Colors, Typography, Spacing, etc.) for consumption in development.

## Documentation
We have automatically generated documentation based on the design tokens:

- [**Foundations**](docs/FOUNDATIONS.md): Core design variables including Colors, Spacing, and other primitives.
- [**Translations**](docs/TRANSLATIONS.md): Localized strings for the application.

## Usage
Design tokens can be transformed for various platforms (Web, iOS, Android) using tools like [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/).

## Contributing
Please ensure any changes to the design tokens in code are reflected in the Figma file and vice versa.
